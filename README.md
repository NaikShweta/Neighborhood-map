The Google Maps JavaScript API lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display on web pages and mobile devices.

The MediaWiki action API is a web service that provides convenient access to wiki features, data, and meta-data over HTTP, via a URL usually at api.php. Clients request particular "actions" by specifying an action parameter, mainly action=query to get information. It was known as the MediaWiki API, but there are now other web APIs available that connect to MediaWiki such as RESTBase and the Wikidata query service.
